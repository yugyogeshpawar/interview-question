## What is init container in kubernetes?
- An init container is a container that runs before the main containers in a pod. It is used to perform initialization tasks that are required before the main containers can start. An example of this could be to download configuration files from a remote server. The init container will run to completion before the main containers start.

## When to use init container in kubernetes?

When to use init container in kubernetes?
- Use an init container if you need to perform initialization tasks that are required before the main containers can start.
- Use an init container if you need to download configuration files from a remote server before the main containers start.
- Use an init container if you need to wait for a specific condition before the main containers start.
- Use an init container if you need to perform setup tasks that require privileged permissions before the main containers start.
- Use an init container if you need to perform database migrations before the main containers start.
- Use an init container if you need to perform complex setup tasks that require multiple steps before the main containers start.
- Use an init container if you need to perform setup tasks that require a specific order before the main containers start.
- Use an init container if you need to perform setup tasks that require a specific delay before the main containers start.

## How to define init container in kubernetes?

You can define an init container in a Kubernetes pod by adding an `initContainers` field to the pod definition. The `initContainers` field is an array of container definitions, just like the `containers` field. 

## How to communicate between init container and main container in kubernetes?

Init containers can communicate with the main containers using the shared volume. This is especially useful when the init container needs to provide some configuration or data to the main container. Here's an example of a pod that uses an init container to download a configuration file and make it available to the main container:

When defining an init container, you can specify a restart policy for the container, just like with the main containers. This ensures that the init container restarts if it fails. You can also specify a timeout for the init container, which specifies how long Kubernetes should wait for the init container to complete before considering it a failure. By default, the timeout is set to 600 seconds.

When defining the init container, you can also specify a termination grace period, which specifies how long Kubernetes should wait for any processes in the init container to terminate before considering the container finished. By default, the termination grace period is set to 30 seconds.

Kubernetes will consider the pod ready when all the init containers have completed, and the main containers are ready to start. This ensures that the pod is only considered ready when the initialization tasks have completed.
